## Security Measures

1. **Dependency Management**: We use Dependabot to monitor and update our dependencies regularly. This helps us maintain the latest security patches.
2. **Code Review**: All changes to the codebase undergo a thorough code review process before being merged.
3. **Regular Audits**: We conduct periodic security audits of our codebase and infrastructure.

## Vulnerability Management

1. Once a vulnerability is reported, we will investigate and validate the issue.
2. We will work on a fix and release it as soon as possible, depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
3. We will notify users of the affected versions and provide upgrade instructions.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage all users and contributors to follow these security best practices:

1. Keep your local environment and dependencies up to date.
2. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts associated with the project.
3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where available.
4. Be cautious when handling sensitive data and avoid committing secrets to the repository.
